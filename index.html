        <div class="about-content">
          <p>I am Angel Maglasang Cabatana, a 21-year-old fourth-year student at Cebu Normal University-Main Campus, where I am pursuing my Bachelor of Elementary Education degree. As the youngest in a family of four, I grew up surrounded by love and encouragement, which inspired me to always aim high and work hard in everything I do.
        </p><br>
          <p>My educational journey started at To-ong Elementary School, where I first discovered my love for learning. I later completed both my junior and senior high school education at San Remigio National High School in my hometown, San Remigio, Cebu. Those years were filled with challenges, triumphs, and experiences that shaped the person I am today. Throughout my life, I have always been an honor and achiever student, striving for excellence in all that I do. I was also an active student leader and youth leader, often finding myself in positions of responsibility where I could inspire and guide others. These experiences taught me the value of leadership, service, and stepping out of my comfort zone to grow and learn.
          </p><br>
          <p>It was during these formative years that I discovered my calling— <b>to become a teacher</b>. Teaching felt more than just a career—it felt like my purpose. I realized that being an educator was my way of creating a meaningful impact on the lives of others. Helping young minds grow, inspiring them to dream, and empowering them to achieve their goals became my ultimate aspiration. However, the journey toward fulfilling this dream has not always been easy. There have been moments when the challenges of my studies and responsibilities seemed too much to bear. There were times when I felt like giving up. Yet, even in those moments of doubt, I reminded myself of the dream that brought me this far. My love for teaching and my vision of shaping the future gave me the strength to keep going, to push through every difficulty, and to work even harder. 
        </p><br>
          <p>Teaching is not just a profession for me—it is a lifelong mission. Despite the challenges, my love for what I do keeps me going. I know that every step I take, every lesson I learn, and every effort I give brings me closer to becoming the teacher I have always dreamed of being.

          <div style="width: 100%; text-align: justify;">
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">The first day of my student teaching internship journey was a mix of emotions. I felt a mix of excitement, curiosity, and nerves as I stepped into this new role—a role I had long dreamed of but was finally living out. It was a significant milestone, and while I was eager to begin, I couldn't shake the anxiety of the unknown, especially a new intern. It all began with the preparation of all the necessary requirements followed by the  orientation and then, the pinning ceremony. These moments felt overwhelming, as though I was crossing a bridge into the reality of becoming a teacher. Standing alongside my fellow student teaching interns, I felt both proud and humbled. We were entering a chapter that would test us in ways we had never imagined. Afterward, we waited to find out who our mentors would be. The uncertainty of who would guide us and the weight of their expectations loomed over me, but I told myself to just trust the process.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">Then came the preparations—classroom cleaning and room structuring. What seemed like simple tasks quickly became daunting challenges. The empty classroom felt overwhelming at first, a blank canvas that needed to be transformed into a vibrant, welcoming learning space. With limited resources, I often found myself frustrated. How would I pull this off? How would I make this room not just functional but inspiring for the young learners who would walk through its doors? But as I slowly chipped away at the task, the frustration gave way to determination. I realized that the struggles were part of the process, and each completed task brought a sense of accomplishment. When everything was finally in place, I looked around the room and felt a swell of pride. This was the first step, a small but significant victory.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;"> As the internship officially began, I was into the daily grind of teaching. Each day presented new struggles, the lesson planning, managing time, building rapport with students, and balancing the responsibility of being both a learner and a teacher. There were moments when I felt utterly exhausted, questioning if I was good enough for this path. Teaching wasn’t just about delivering lessons, it was about managing a classroom, adapting on the fly, and responding to the unique needs of each child. Some days were harder than others. There were times when nothing seemed to go right—when a lesson plan didn’t happen as I had hoped, or when a classroom situation left me feeling defeated. Frustration would creep in, and the thought of giving up would cross my mind. But in those moments, I reminded myself why I started this journey. I remembered the dreams I had as a child, the passion for teaching that had burned within me for so long. That reminder was enough to push me forward.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">Eventually, the responsibility of being a student teacher began to settle. I started to find myself in this field. The lessons I had agonized over flowed more naturally, and my confidence grew with each passing day. The bond I developed with my students became my greatest source of motivation. Their smiles, their curiosity, and even their challenges reminded me of why I wanted to become a teacher in the first place. Looking back now, I see that this journey was not just about teaching students, it was about learning myself. I learned that patience is not just a virtue but a necessity in this profession. I discovered that resilience is built through every struggle and that success is sweeter when earned through perseverance. I realized the importance of being adaptable and open to change because no day in teaching is ever the same. Most importantly, I learned that being a teacher is about more than delivering lessons, it’s about making connections, inspiring young minds, and believing in their potential, even on the toughest days. This teaching internship has shaped me in ways I never expected, and though the journey was far from easy, it was worth every challenge.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;"> As I reflect on this experience, I feel proud of how far I’ve come. From that nervous student intern on the first day to someone who has overcome daily struggles, frustrations, and doubts, I am stronger, wiser, and more determined than ever to fulfill my calling as a teacher. This is only the beginning, but it’s a beginning that has prepared me to face the future with courage, passion, and unwavering faith in the power of education.
