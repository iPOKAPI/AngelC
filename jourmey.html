    <div class="lesson-content">
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">Stepping into the role of a student teacher intern in a multigrade classroom was both thrilling and intimidating. Multigrade teaching was a world I had only read about, and now I was living it—an environment where students of different grade levels, abilities, and needs shared one space. On my first day, I was overwhelmed by questions: How do I balance teaching multiple levels? How do I ensure each student is learning? Am I truly ready for this challenge?
        </p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">The first  struggle I had  lay in lesson planning. Crafting lessons that addressed multiple grade levels at once felt like solving a complex puzzle. Each lesson needed to be engaging, differentiated, and tailored to meet the needs of every learner. The pressure to think of appropriate activities and strategies was immense. I would sit at my desk for hours, brainstorming ideas, searching for inspiration, and trying to imagine how each lesson would play out. There were nights when I barely slept. The deadlines emerged  over me, and the weight of responsibility pressed harder as I struggled to finish lesson plans on time. The process of preparing each lesson from conceptualizing objectives to designing activities and crafting assessments required a lot of effort. I often found myself starting from scratch, pouring all my energy into creating plans that I hoped would resonate with my students.
        </p><br>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">Even after hours of working with my lesson plans, the struggle didn’t end. After submitting my lesson plans, minor revisions would be suggested by my mentor. Though the feedback was constructive, it stung a little, knowing that what I had worked so hard on wasn’t perfect. But I understood that these revisions weren’t setbacks, they were opportunities to learn and improve. Slowly, I began to accept that perfection wasn’t the goal; growth was. Despite the sleepless nights, the frustrations, and the moments of self-doubt, I managed to meet the challenges head-on. I developed a routine, learned to manage my time better, and began to trust my instincts. As the days went by, what once felt like an impossible task became more manageable. Lesson planning transformed from a source of frustration into a creative process I began to enjoy. I realized that it wasn’t just about writing objectives or designing activities, it was about envisioning how students would experience the lesson, how they would engage, and how they would learn.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Teaching in a multigrade classroom also taught me adaptability. No matter how carefully I planned, lessons didn’t always go as expected. I had to think on my feet, adjust to the needs of my students, and embrace flexibility. These challenges taught me resilience and resourcefulness—qualities that are invaluable to any teacher. The sleepless nights and countless revisions shaped me into a more capable and confident teacher. I learned that struggles are a natural part of growth and that persistence pays off. I discovered the value of collaboration and feedback and how these can refine not just my work but also my perspective.
        </p style="font-size: 15px;"><br>
        <p>
            This experience in a multigrade classroom has taught me that no challenge is impossible with determination, creativity, and a willingness to learn. It reaffirmed my passion for teaching and strengthened my resolve to make a difference in the lives of my students, no matter the obstacles. Through this journey, I learned that lesson planning is not just about meeting deadlines or ticking boxes. It’s about being thoughtful, innovative, and adaptable.

            <p style="font-size: 15px;">As a student teacher intern, one of the most challenging yet rewarding parts of my journey was preparing instructional materials and PowerPoint presentations for every lesson and teaching demonstration. Each time I faced the task, I felt the pressure of creating something both meaningful and engaging for my students, all while managing the limited time I had to pull everything together. The preparation often felt overwhelming. Time was never on my side, with deadlines looming and a long list of tasks to accomplish. There were countless moments when I doubted whether I could deliver the kind of quality I envisioned. But despite the struggles, I found ways to manage and thrive. To begin with, I prioritized creativity and functionality in my instructional materials. I made it a point to create materials that were vibrant, visually appealing, and eye-catching, as I wanted them to spark my students’ interest and excitement. I often worked with themes whether it was animals, nature, or a concept tied to the lesson to make the materials more relatable and engaging. These themes allowed me to add a personal and imaginative touch to every visual aid or activity sheet.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">I also focused on the practicality of my materials. I ensured that my visual aids were big enough for everyone in the classroom to see clearly. I wanted every child, no matter where they were seated, to feel included and engaged. Beyond size, I made my materials interactive whenever possible, incorporating elements like movable parts, flaps to lift, or spaces for students to write and draw. I believed that learning should be hands-on, and I wanted my materials to encourage active participation. PowerPoint presentations were another significant part of my preparation. Given the limited time, I adopted strategies to work efficiently without compromising on quality. I used templates and saved valuable time by organizing my content systematically. Every slide was carefully thought out, with vibrant designs, clear visuals, and concise text that complimented my verbal explanation.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;"> Managing my time was one of the biggest lessons I learned throughout this process. I created a routine to handle the pressure, allocating specific blocks of time to prepare my materials and breaking the tasks into smaller, manageable steps. By staying disciplined and focused, I was able to meet deadlines without sacrificing the quality of my work. There were nights of little sleep and moments of frustration, but I pushed through, driven by my desire to provide the best learning experience for my students. Every time I stood in front of the class and saw my students’ eager faces as they interacted with my materials, I felt an overwhelming sense of fulfillment. What made this journey even more rewarding was knowing that my efforts paid off. My students were engaged, excited, and actively participating in lessons. Their smiles and enthusiasm reminded me why I chose to become a teacher.
            <br><br></p> <p style="font-size: 15px;">This experience taught me invaluable lessons. I learned that preparation is not just about meeting requirements, it's about creating a connection between the teacher and the learners. I discovered that even in the face of limited time and resources, creativity, and resourcefulness can make a significant impact. Most importantly, I realized that teaching is about going the extra mile to make every lesson meaningful and memorable. The process of preparing instructional materials and presentations may have been demanding, but it was also one of the most fulfilling parts of my internship.

          <div style="width: 100%; text-align: justify;">
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">Teaching a multigrade classroom is a challenge.I had to ensure that both groups of learners were engaged and learning effectively, even though their levels and needs varied.  It wasn’t easy to manage their attention, especially when I had to focus on delivering a lesson to one group while ensuring the other group stayed on task. In addition, time constraints and the lack of practice often left me feeling unprepared and nervous. Managing two grade levels at the same time was far from easy; it required patience, creativity, and a lot of careful planning. Each day brought new struggles, but it also gave me opportunities to grow, adapt, and develop my skills as an aspiring teacher. 
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">To manage these challenges, I adopted several strategies. First, I created routines for the students to follow. Establishing a clear structure helped them know what to expect, which made the classroom environment more organized and predictable. For example, I designed routines for transitions, group work, and individual tasks, and I made sure to practice these routines with the students until they became familiar.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;"> Classroom management was another significant challenge. With two distinct sets of learners, keeping them focused and engaged simultaneously required careful planning and consistent effort. I quickly realized that without a structured system, the classroom could easily become chaotic. To address this, I established routines and rules that the students could follow and practice daily. These routines, such as lining up for materials, transitioning smoothly between tasks, and taking turns during discussions, created a sense of order and predictability, making the classroom environment more manageable. Building rapport with my students was also crucial. I made an effort to connect with them by using their names, showing genuine interest in their ideas, and creating an interactive learning environment. I incorporated activities that encouraged participation, such as games, storytelling, and group discussions. These strategies not only made the lessons more engaging but also helped maintain their attention throughout the session.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">One of the most important aspects of my teaching demonstrations was ensuring that I was confident and well-prepared, even with limited practice time. I learned that mastery of the lesson content was key to delivering it effectively. Before stepping into the classroom, I reviewed my lesson plans thoroughly and anticipated possible questions or challenges. While I didn’t always have time to rehearse, I made sure that I understood the lesson deeply so I could teach it naturally and with confidence. Despite the struggles, there were moments of fulfillment that made all the effort worthwhile. Seeing my students engaged with the lessons and genuinely interested in what I was teaching gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment. Their smiles, questions, and enthusiasm reassured me that I was making a positive impact, even in a challenging setting.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">Through these experiences, I learned valuable lessons that will stay with me as I continue my journey in education. I learned that preparation is not just about having materials ready, it’s about understanding your lesson and being flexible enough to adapt to the needs of your students. Confidence and a positive attitude play a huge role in how students perceive you as a teacher, and building that confidence starts with believing in yourself. I learned that teaching is not about perfection but about progress. It’s about finding ways to make learning meaningful and ensuring that every student feels valued and heard. Teaching a multigrade classroom taught me resilience, adaptability, and the importance of connection. I am proud of how I managed to pull everything off despite the challenges. Each teaching demonstration was an opportunity to learn, improve, and grow as an educator. These experiences not only strengthened my skills but also deepened my passion for teaching and my commitment to making a difference in the lives of my students.

        <hr style="width: 100vw; padding: 2px; background-color: orange;"><br>
          <div class="lesson-content">
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">Creating my first periodical exam as a student teacher intern was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences I’ve had. At first, I had no idea how to even start. The thought of designing an exam for a multigrade classroom, with questions tailored to both Grade 2 and Grade 3 learners, was overwhelming. I worried about how to align the questions with their learning competencies and ensure the test was fair and balanced. The process was frustrating at first, especially with the pressure of deadlines and my inexperience. I spent hours drafting questions, only to second-guess myself repeatedly. The process started with confusion and frustration. These questions flooded my mind: What format should I use? How can I make it balanced? How do I ensure that both grades are fairly assessed without overwhelming myself or the students? I realized quickly that I didn’t just need to test their knowledge; I needed to align the questions with the learning competencies for each grade, incorporate a variety of question types, and make sure the exam was challenging yet achievable for my students. Thankfully, my mentor was there to guide me. She taught me how to structure the test properly, and gave me feedback on my drafts. Her advice on creating clear instructions and diverse question types such as multiple-choice, true-or-false, and short answers helped me improve the quality of my work.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">The biggest challenge was managing the multigrade aspect. I had to carefully organize the test so that both grades had distinct yet equally meaningful questions. I also had to consider the varying abilities of the learners and make sure the exam was neither too easy nor too difficult. Despite the struggles and a few revisions along the way, I eventually completed the exam. Administering it to my students was a proud moment, as I saw them engage with the questions I had prepared. This experience taught me valuable lessons about preparation, patience, and persistence. I learned that seeking guidance is essential and that every challenge is an opportunity to grow. Crafting that exam not only improved my skills but also boosted my confidence as a future educator.

              <p style="font-size: 15px;">As I look back on my teaching internship journey, I am overwhelmed with gratitude and full of gratitude at how I made it through what seemed like an unending series of challenges. It was a season that tested not just my skills as a future teacher but my faith, patience, and determination. When I started this internship journey, I was unsure of how I would handle the responsibility of standing in front of young minds eager to learn. I knew I wanted to make an impact, but I had no idea how much the experience would change me.
              </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">Every day brought a mix of emotions, there was joy, frustration, hope, and exhaustion. The first time I stepped into the multigrade classroom, I felt excitement, coupled with the weight of responsibility. There were days I felt fulfilled as I saw they learned from me.  But there were also days when I doubted myself when lessons didn’t go as planned, or when managing a class felt overwhelming. Despite the struggles, every smile, every "Thank you, teacher," and their smiles reminded me why I chose this path. I saw their eagerness to learn, and their trust in me as their teacher. These moments fueled my passion to keep going, no matter how hard it got.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">My internship was far from smooth. I experienced moments of setbacks that tested my emotional and mental strength. There were times I felt defeated when my methods didn’t work, when students struggled to understand, or when I made mistakes that I thought I should have avoided. Balancing lesson planning, teaching, and my own studies was exhausting. Late nights, early mornings, and the constant pressure to perform at my best took a toll on me. I experienced breakdowns where I questioned if I was truly meant for this profession. But in those moments, I realized that struggles were part of the process, they were shaping me to be a better, stronger teacher.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">Through it all, I learned resilience. I learned that mistakes are not failures but opportunities to grow. I learned the value of patience not just with my students, but with myself. I learned to celebrate small wins and victories and to find joy in the simple moments of teaching. Aside from that, I also discovered the importance of collaboration and support. My mentors, peers, family,  and even my students became sources of inspiration and encouragement. They taught me that teaching is not just my journey, it’s a partnership built on trust, understanding, and mutual growth.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">Throughout my journey, I held on to my faith in God. I prayed for strength when I felt weak, wisdom when I felt lost, and peace when I felt overwhelmed. There were times when I wanted to give up, but God always reminded me of my purpose. He sent me people like my supportive mentors, friends, and even my students who unknowingly became instruments of His guidance. I saw His hand in every step of my journey, from the lessons I learned to the challenges I overcame.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">God reminded me that I wasn’t alone—that He was with me every step of the way, shaping me not just as a teacher, but as a person. His grace sustained me, and His promises gave me the courage to keep going.
            </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">This journey has been one of the most challenging seasons of my life, but it has also been one of the most rewarding. I’ve grown in ways I never imagined, and I’ve seen how God can turn struggles into strength. As I near the end of this chapter, I carry with me not just memories, but lessons that will guide me in the future. I am ready to face whatever comes next, knowing that I have the tools, the faith, and the courage to overcome anything. This is my story and my journey, a journey of faith and resilience.

        <hr style="width: 100vw; padding: 2px; background-color: orange;"><br>
        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">Looking back at the experience of preparing for the Center-Based Learning Activity (CBLA), I’m reminded of how much I learned about collaboration, resilience, and the power of adaptability. The task seemed daunting at first—creating a lesson plan, designing a PowerPoint presentation, and preparing all the instructional materials within a short timeframe. At the start, I was filled with a mix of excitement and anxiety, knowing that time was limited and there were so many pieces to put together.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">The process of drafting the lesson plan went smoothly, but as soon as we shifted our focus to the PowerPoint presentation and gathering the materials, we hit some roadblocks. The technical glitches, missing materials, and time constraints felt overwhelming at times. But despite these struggles, I saw the true value of working as a team. We divided the tasks, supported each other, and worked together to solve problems creatively. Every time we found a solution, I felt a sense of accomplishment, and that drove us forward.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">In the end, the CBLA was a success. The students engaged fully in the activities, and seeing them learn and have fun made all the stress and struggles worthwhile. This experience taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, teamwork, and the importance of staying calm under pressure. It reminded me that teaching isn’t just about delivering a perfect lesson plan—it’s about navigating challenges, thinking on your feet, and being flexible in the face of adversity.
            </p><br>
            <p  style="font-size: 15px;">The most important takeaway from this experience was realizing that no matter how difficult a situation might seem, with the right mindset and a strong team, success is always achievable. The journey wasn’t easy, but it was incredibly rewarding, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to have grown through this challenge.

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">The Christmas Hat Making activity in the Art Center was a wonderful experience for both the students and myself. It was a simple yet meaningful way to engage the children in a creative process, and through this, I learned a lot about the value of hands-on activities in teaching.
                </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">At the start of the activity, the students were eager and excited to create their own Christmas hats. As they worked with colorful materials using colorful beads, I saw them using their imagination to design something unique. It was amazing to watch their creativity flow freely, each child adding their personal touch to their hats. This showed me how art can be a great way for students to express themselves and feel proud of their creations. There were some challenges, especially when students struggled to put the materials together or had difficulty with certain parts of the project. In those moments, I learned the importance of patience and encouragement. I realized that it wasn’t just about helping them finish the task, it was about guiding them through the process, letting them figure things out on their own, and giving them the confidence to keep trying.
                </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">In the end, seeing the students proudly wear their Christmas hats was a rewarding moment. It reminded me that creativity, even in small activities, helps build their confidence, and makes learning fun. This experience reinforced the idea that teaching isn’t only about delivering lessons, it’s also about giving students opportunities to explore, express, and grow in their own way.

               <p style="font-size: 15px;">Our Center-Based Learning Activity in the Interpersonal Center, where students shared blessings by giving bundles of joy to our school staff and performed a Christmas song for them, was truly a heartwarming experience. The students not only prepared gifts for the guards, janitors, and gardeners but also took the time to practice and sing a Christmas song to show their appreciation.
               </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">As I watched the students prepare the bundles and rehearse the song, I was reminded of how powerful small acts of kindness can be. The students were excited not just to give, but to express their gratitude to them. . It was a beautiful moment of connection, where the students learned the importance of appreciating the hard work of the school staff. The smiles on the staff members' faces as they received the gifts and listened to the song made everything feel even more special.
               </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">From this experience, I learned that sharing blessings isn’t just about material gifts. It's about showing appreciation and spreading joy. The students learned that kindness comes in many forms, and that simple gestures like a song or a small gift can make someone’s day brighter. I also realized that teaching students the value of gratitude and empathy can make a positive impact on their character, helping them grow into compassionate individuals. This activity reminded me of the importance of community and how acts of kindness, no matter how small, can create a positive and uplifting environment for everyone.

                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Our Center-Based Learning Activity in the Bodily/Musical Center, where the students sang a Christmas song, was a joyful and engaging experience. The students were excited to participate, and it was clear that music brought a sense of unity and happiness to the activity. As we practiced the song, I could see how much the children enjoyed expressing themselves through singing, with their voices filling the room and their faces bright with smiles.
                </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">One important lesson I learned from this experience is how music can be a powerful tool for learning and expression. It was not only about memorizing lyrics but also about getting involved in the rhythm and melody, which helped the students feel more connected to the spirit of the season. The children were able to work together, listen to each other, and improve their performance as a team, which enhanced their sense of cooperation and shared purpose.

Overall, this activity reinforced the value of music as an effective teaching tool that promotes creativity, teamwork, and self-expression. It reminded me that learning doesn’t always have to be traditional, it can be fun and memorable, helping students develop skills in ways they enjoy.

                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">As a student intern, crafting the questions for the Quiz Bowl and preparing the PowerPoint presentation was a challenging but rewarding experience. At first, I felt a bit overwhelmed by the task, as I needed to ensure that the questions were not only educational but also engaging for the students. I quickly learned that creating good quiz questions requires a balance between difficulty and accessibility, making sure the questions are fair but still challenging enough to spark interest.
                    </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">The process of preparing the PowerPoint presentation was another valuable learning experience. I learned  how important visuals and clear design are in keeping the students' attention and helping them understand the content. I had to be mindful of making the slides simple, organized, and visually appealing to support the learning process rather than distract from it.
                    </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">Through this task, I learned the importance of preparation and attention to detail. I also gained a better understanding of how to make learning fun and interactive. The quiz bowl format allowed me to practice thinking critically about how to present information in a way that was both challenging and enjoyable for the students. It also taught me how to organize content effectively, ensuring that it was easy to follow. This experience showed me how essential it is to combine creativity with clarity in teaching materials. As I move forward in my journey as an educator, I’ll take these lessons with me, knowing that thoughtful preparation can make a huge difference in how students engage with the content.

                    <p style="font-size: 15px;">As a student teaching intern, being part of various school activities during our shift at CNU-ILS has been a rewarding and insightful experience. These activities not only provided me with practical teaching experience but also helped me gain a deeper understanding of the broader role of a teacher in the students' lives. One of the first school activities I was involved in was the <b><i>Buwan ng Wika Celebration 2024</i></b>. We organized a small celebration in our room, where we prepared several activities for the learners to help them celebrate the Filipino language and culture. I was amazed by how much the students enjoyed the activities. This experience taught me that cultural activities are a powerful tool in making learning more meaningful. As a teacher, it’s important to create opportunities for students to engage with this kind of celebration, fostering a sense of pride and belonging. As a student teacher, learning should always be more than just academic, it should also connect with the students’ personal experiences and identities.
                    </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">Another key experience during our shift was helping the third batch facilitate the <b><i>United Nations 2024 celebration</i></b>. We assisted in managing the students during their practice sessions, guiding them through preparations right up until the day of the celebration. This experience also showed me how important it is to be flexible. Sometimes things don’t go as planned, and it’s crucial to stay calm, adjust when necessary, and support your team and students. From these activities, I also gained a better understanding of the broader role of a student teacher. As a teacher, you're not only responsible for delivering lessons but also for supporting students in other aspects of their growth, cultural, social, and emotional. Through participating in these school events, I built stronger relationships with the students, seeing them not just as learners but as individuals with their own interests and talents. It reminded me that teaching extends beyond academics; it’s about being a guide, a mentor, and someone who helps students grow into well-rounded individuals.
                    </p><br><p style="font-size: 15px;">One of the most valuable lessons I took away from these experiences is the importance of engaging students outside the classroom. Activities like the Buwan ng Wika and the United Nations celebration allowed students to express themselves creatively and socially. It was a reminder that learning isn’t confined to textbooks; it happens in different environments, through interactions, and through activities that challenge students in new ways. Engaging students in these activities fosters a sense of community, responsibility, and creativity and skills that go beyond the classroom. These experiences taught me invaluable lessons about teaching and student engagement. They reinforced the idea that as a teacher, my role is not just to educate students academically but to guide them in their personal growth, foster a positive classroom environment, and be involved in their learning journey, both inside and outside the classroom. I am grateful for these experiences, as they have helped shape me into a more well-rounded future educator, ready to face the challenges and joys that come with teaching.

        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">Meeting the parents during our first PTA meeting in a multigrade was meaningful. It gave me the opportunity to connect with the people who play a vital role in the lives of our students. Introducing myself, I made sure to approach them warmly and respectfully, sharing my role, a bit about my background, and my goals for their children. This experience reinforced how crucial it is for teachers and parents to collaborate. Parents bring valuable insights about their child’s personality, strengths, and challenges, which help teachers provide a more personalized approach to learning. Through working together and communication, we create a strong support system for the students, both at home and in school. This teamwork not only helps children succeed academically but also nurtures their confidence and emotional well-being.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">The meeting also reminded me of the importance of building trust and maintaining open communication with parents. When parents see that we value their input and treat them as partners in their child’s education, they feel more engaged and willing to support learning activities. As a future teacher, I aim to foster this collaboration continuously, ensuring that parents feel welcome and involved in the learning process. Overall, the experience taught me that teaching is not just about guiding students but it is also about forming meaningful partnerships with their families.Through working hand in hand, we can provide the best learning experience for every child.

        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">As a student teacher, I feel deeply grateful for the warm and kind relationship I have built with the parents of my students. Despite my role as a student teacher, they have consistently treated me with the respect and trust of a full-fledged teacher. This has been both humbling and encouraging, as their belief in me inspires confidence in my teaching abilities. The parents have been incredibly thoughtful and kind in their interactions. They approach me with genuine concern for their child’s progress, always speaking with a kind heart. Their openness in discussing their concerns and their willingness to collaborate have made communication smooth and meaningful. I am particularly touched by how they warmly greet me whenever we meet, even outside the school. It reflects their thoughtfulness, respect, and appreciation, which motivate me to give my best in guiding and supporting their children.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">Through these experiences, I have learned the importance of building trust and nurturing relationships with parents. Their support plays a significant role in creating a positive learning environment for the students. I have also realized how important it is to listen actively to their concerns and to acknowledge the trust they place in teachers to shape their child’s future.One key learning for me is that respect and kindness go a long way in fostering strong partnerships. When parents see that we care for their children wholeheartedly, they respond with the same sincerity and trust. This experience has reminded me of a beautiful quote by Rita Pierson: <i>“Every child deserves a champion—an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be.”</i>
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">As I continue my journey as a future teacher, I carry with me the importance of these relationships. Parents are not just stakeholders in education—they are partners. Together, we create a community that nurtures children to grow and succeed, both inside and outside the classroom.

    <div class="lesson-content">
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">Dealing with incident reports in the classroom has been a learning experience that tested both my patience and decision-making skills. Each situation required me to stay calm, think clearly, and ensure fairness while resolving the issue. These moments taught me not just how to handle conflicts, but also how to guide students toward better behavior and understanding. When an incident occurs in the classroom, my first step is to address it immediately but calmly to our mentor. I make sure to gather all the necessary details by listening to everyone involved. I let the students explain their side of the story one at a time, without interrupting them. This not only helps me understand the situation better but also shows the students that their voices are valued.
    </p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">After hearing everyone out, I carefully analyze the problem and identify what caused it. Some incidents stem from misunderstandings, while others may involve rules being broken or emotions running high. Once I know what happened, I explain to the students involved why their actions had consequences and how those actions affected others. I make it a point to remain fair, ensuring that no one feels singled out or judged unfairly. Depending on the nature of the incident, I decide on an appropriate course of action. If it’s a minor issue, I often resolve it by having the students apologize and reflect on how they could have acted differently. For more serious matters, I document the incident and inform the parents, ensuring transparency and collaboration in addressing the behavior. In every case, I aim to turn the incident into a learning opportunity, helping students understand how to handle similar situations in the future.
    </p><br>
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">One key thing I’ve learned is the importance of staying composed and being consistent with rules. Children look to teachers not just for knowledge, but also for guidance in how to handle challenges.These experiences have taught me that managing incidents in the classroom is not just about solving problems but about teaching life skills. It’s about helping students take responsibility for their actions, understand the impact of their choices, and grow into better individuals. I always remind myself of this simple truth: "Every mistake is a chance to learn." Through each incident report I handle, I am reminded of my role as not just a teacher, but also a mentor guiding my students toward personal growth and better decision-making.

                Guided by Faith, Growing as a Teacher</h2><br>

        <div class="lesson-content">
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">As I reflect on my five-month teaching internship in Cebu Normal University- Integrated Laboratory School , I can’t help but think about the many challenges, setbacks, and moments of growth I’ve experienced. This journey has truly tested my resilience, patience, and determination. There were times when I doubted myself, moments when I felt overwhelmed by the responsibilities of managing a classroom and meeting the expectations of my mentors. Yet, through it all, I learned more than I ever expected not just about teaching, but about myself and the strength I possess.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">At the beginning, everything felt new and intimidating. There were moments of self-doubt, especially when things didn’t go as planned. Managing a classroom full of energetic students was more difficult than I had imagined, and keeping up with lesson plans, grading, and other responsibilities sometimes felt like an impossible task. I had to adjust quickly to a pace I was unfamiliar with, balancing both my academic work and the demands of being in the classroom. There were setbacks, lessons that didn’t go as I had envisioned, students who struggled to connect with the material, and situations where I felt like I wasn’t making the impact I hoped for. It was easy to feel discouraged in those moments, but through each struggle, I learned to adapt and try new approaches. The key was not to give up, even when things didn’t go smoothly. I started realizing that teaching isn’t about perfection but about persistence and adaptability.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">Looking back, what helped me the most was leaning on my faith. In the toughest moments, when I felt like I couldn’t go any further, I turned to God for guidance. There were times when I felt completely drained, and in those moments, I felt God’s quiet strength carrying me through. I felt His presence in the little victories when a student finally understood a lesson, when a parent expressed appreciation, or when I had the courage to face a new challenge. These were reminders that I wasn’t walking this journey alone.
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">God’s guidance became clear in every situation. I realized that my struggles weren’t just obstacles but opportunities for growth. I learned to trust in His plan, knowing that every difficult moment was shaping me into the teacher I am meant to be. There were days when I wanted to quit, but I was reminded that I was called to this path, and God was there to guide me every step of the way. In the end, my internship was not just about learning teaching strategies and classroom management, it was about learning to trust in myself and in God’s plan for my life. I’ve come to understand that teaching is not just a career but a calling, and that with faith, perseverance, and the support of those around me, I can overcome any challenge. 
            </p><br>
            <p style="font-size: 15px;">As I look forward to becoming a full-time teacher, I know that this experience has equipped me with the tools, wisdom, and strength I need to succeed. The Bible verses that have been my guiding light  and that have carried me through this journey are Jeremiah 29:11 and Proverbs 3:5. "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future." (Jeremiah 29:11) and "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." (Proverbs 3:5). These verses remind me that God’s plan for me is good, and that no matter how tough things get, I can trust in Him to guide me through.
